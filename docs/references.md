# References

References are the collection of metadata surrounding the `execute` method generated by the `ExecutionBuilder`.

These contain metadata about the execution, as well as the `execute` method itself.
- executed tracks if an execution has completed.
- executing tracks if an execution is already under way.
- state simplifies the combination of the executed and executing properties.
- lastExecutedAt tracks the last time that an execution completed.
- execute is a method to trigger the execution.

There are reference transformers that may be applied to append additional properties, such as forms, error, and status information. These transformers may be added by `then` clauses.
